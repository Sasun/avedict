AVEDict
=======
AVEDict aims to be a simple but practically useful dictionary application running on the Android platform.

AVEDict was initially inspired by the StarDict(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/StarDict">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/StarDict</a>), an excellent cross-platform desktop dictionary.

Takes dictionary format same as the StarDict.

Supports English-Chinese dictionary currently, extra effort should to be made to enable it running other dictionary files, Chinese character indexed files, for example.

It is an Eclipse project, and you can set it up easily in an IDE such as Google ADT.

For copyright reasons, dictionary files are not included here, you can find some at <a href="http://irising.me/2011/07/9021/">http://irising.me/2011/07/9021/</a>
